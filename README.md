# Instragram-like â™¥ button implementation using mostly just CSS

This repository contains an example of an Instagram-like heart button 
implemented and animated using mostly just CSS. JavaScript has been used 
sparingly to provide non-essential enhancements such as the ability to 
double-click the image instead of the label, providing keyboard navigation 
cues, and so on.

## Running the example

The example is "run" by opening the `index.html` file in your browser. No 
development servers are needed.
